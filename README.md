All the data for this came from the https://github.com/UBC-MDS repository for programming-in-python-for-data-science.

I cloned it, so it would be easier to take notes in VS while I completed the modules.

This is my first attempt and experience with Python. I wanted to use VS for notes and to run code, all thought all the assignments are done in Jupyter Notebook.

I created a conda enviroment with miniconda called myenv with panda, pip and altair. (Had to google to figure it out).

I got it to work, but I don't think I fully understand the concepts. I do take a course after this one which will go over how to install and run code on a local machine, including conda enviroments. I was just excited that I was able to figure it out and be able to use VS for this course.

And that's all that's it for now.

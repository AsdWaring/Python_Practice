All the data for this came from the https://github.com/UBC-MDS repository for programming-in-python-for-data-science.

I cloned it, so it would be easier to take notes in VS while I completed the modules. I did this in module 2 - so from module 2 on I'll be using the data folder. Maybe when I feel inclined i will updated the code from assignment1 to the new links.

This is my first attempt and experience with Python. I wanted to use VS for notes and to run code, all thought all the assignments are done in Jupyter Notebook.

I created a conda enviroment with miniconda called myenv with panda, pip and altair. (Had to google to figure it out).

I got it to work, but I don't think I fully understand the concepts. I do take a course after this one which will go over how to install and run code on a local machine, including conda enviroments. I was just excited that I was able to figure it out and be able to use VS for this course.

And that's all that's it for now.

Just kidding - I went to go and load an excel data set and I need to install openpyxl into my conda enviroment.

Done and done, and at their suggestion at https://openpyxl.readthedocs.io/en/stable/

I installed pillow as well.
